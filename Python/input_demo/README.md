This recipe demonstrates some keyboard input functions and screen output "magic" that some people may be interested (such as for an ASCII game). It is meant as a very simple demonstration only, and does not contain any error checking whatsoever. The style of the code is not the best, but it is meant to get a point across.<br>NOTE: This code was written to work in windows.
