DAL6 provides the cap of the Disk Abstraction
Layers and a way to create Context objects.
These Context objects provide relative paths
and keep track of the Currect Working
Directory. A method for renaming was
accidentally left out of the API. This
recipe also provides a full abstraction for
files involving full buffering and including
most of methods that should be expected.
