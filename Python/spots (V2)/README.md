This recipe is the core of something called FDR
(Full Duplex RPC). FDR has not been completed at
this time, but the "spots" module takes most of
the work off of other modules in network chatter.
This is the second version of "spots" and simplifies
the ZSP class while getting rid of the base255 module.
