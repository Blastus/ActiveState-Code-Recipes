This is a revisiting of Recipe 502216. All the code is new in this implementation, and the concept has been advanced into something akin to a screensaver. Development has ended on this version until work can be done on a third version that takes the to-do lists into account in a more structured way. Feel free to modify this code as you wish (as someone apparently did in the original recipe). If nothing else, it can serve as a short diversion from the predictability of life. Enjoy!
